# Online-shopping
Web Project

This system can be implemented to any shop in the locality or to
multinational branded shops having retail outlet chains. The system
recommends a facility to accept the orders 24*7 and a home delivery
system which can make customers happy. If shops are providing an
online portal where their customers can enjoy easy shopping from
anywhere, the shops wonâ€™t be losing any more customers to the
trending online shops such as flipcart or ebay. Since the application is
easily accessible online .
